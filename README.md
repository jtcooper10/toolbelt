# Josh's Linux Toolbelt

A repository of .env files, config folders, useful scripts, and tools galore. The goal is for everything here to be 100% POSIX-compliant, so that I can use these on every machine I run.

`conf` is for configuration files, and `scripts` is for useful scripts. Run `./clear.sh` to clear out any old config folders and files, run `init.sh` to install new ones.
